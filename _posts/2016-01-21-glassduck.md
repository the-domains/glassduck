I've tried this before.. I've had a professional website made, I've made my own website, I tried tumblr and wordpress.  But no matter what I tried, it never seemed to work out.  Totally my fault. I'd rather make stuff, than talk about it.  I'd rather be in the hotshop or in my studio, than at my computer updating or creating posts. Maybe it's because I want to share the progress of the glass dress that I'm making, or maybe I'm just ready to take my business more seriously - _not too seriously though, let's not get carried away. _ But probably it's because it's become a whole lot easier to make an maintain a website, so here goes.

I haven't totally figured out this new ai, but I'll get there.
